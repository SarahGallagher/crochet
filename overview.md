# Crochet 

## What is crochet?
Similar to knitting, crochet is a method of "stitching" yarn up to create a fabric piece. 

Crocheted items can be more "bulky" than knitting and may use more yarn than knitted pieces. The big benefit of crochet is that you use one hook, and work one stitch at a time. Because you don't carry your stitches on a needle like knitting, and because crochet hooks are typically smaller than knitting needles, it becomes very easy to travel with your work in progress without worrying about stitches being dropped. 


## Getting Started
When you begin, you'll need two items: yarn, and a crochet hook.

Yarn comes in different weights, sizes, and materials, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Arclylic yarn can be a great choice for beginners: it tends to be cheaper than other materials like wool or cotton, and it's typically very durable when resused in different projects. It's usually machine washable as well.

Crochet hooks come in a variety of sizes and materials. Most beginner and cheaper hooks are made with aluminuim or plastic. Aluminium tends to be a better choice as it's more "slippery" than plastic. Hooks will vary in price and quality.

## Gauge
Gauge is a measurement of your stitches compared to others. Gauge is unique to each person. How you hold your yarn and hook, as well as how "loose" or "tight" you crochet, will affect your gauge (or, the overall size of your project). While gauge doesn't matter in every project, it can matter in "wearable" projects (hats, sweaters, socks, etc).
 
Before you start a project, it's recommended that you create a swatch. A swatch is typically a large sample square crocheted in the same stitch that the pattern calls for (or another stitch as inidcated by the author). After you complete your swatch, you'll measure your stitches with a rular and compare it to the pattern's gauge notes. If your swatch is too big, you should try again with a smaller hook size. Likewise, if your swatch is too small, you should try again with a larger hook size. You may need to repeat this process with different hook sizes until your swatch measurements match the author's.
 
It's worthwhile to note that your tension can change during a project, especially when you are first learning how to crochet. This is normal! Your tension will improve as you practice. 

## Optional materials
### Stitch markers
Stitch markers are used to "mark" a stitch. Stitch markers can come in different materials, ranging from premade plastic pieces, to something more simple like a contrasting piece of scap yarn. Anything that can "mark" a stitch can be used as a stitch marker.

It's common to place stitch markers in the first and last stitches of your row, especially when you are first learning how to crochet, to prevent accidental stitch increases or decreases. It's also common to use stitch markers when you are working in the round (amigurmi), or when working with more difficult or textured yarn where it's harder to see your individual stitches (like faux fur yarn). 

### Yarn bowl
A yawn bowl is bowl or container that holds your yarn as you crochet. This can be a handy when you are working with the "outside" tail of the yarn where your yarn can flop around as you pull from it. Some yarn bowls have cutouts or holes that you can use to better direct your yarn.

### Tapestry needle
Typically used to help you weave in/hide your ends. You can also weave in your ends with a crochet hook. 

## Common stitches and techniques  
Most crochet patterns are just a combination of common crochet stitches. 

Most patterns will use stitch abbreviations to save space and time. There should be a stitch legend on the pattern page to explain what each abbreviation means.
