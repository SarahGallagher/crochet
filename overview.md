 # Getting Started
 You'll need two things: yarn, and a hook. 

 # Note
 ## Terminology
 This document is written with US crochet terminology. You'll find that some crochet stitches are named differently between US and UK terminology. Before you begin a project, you should check what terminology the author is using.


 ## Gauge
 Gauge is unique to each person. How you hold your yarn and hook, as well as how "loose" or "tight" you crochet your stitches, will affect your gauge (or, size of your project). While gauge doesn't matter in every project, it can matter in projects like "wearables" (hats, sweaters, socks, etc).
 
 Before you start a project, it's recommended that you create a swatch. A swatch is typically a large square crocheted in the same stitch of the pattern (or another stitch as inidcated by the author). After you complete your swatch, you'll measure your stitches with a rular and compare it to the pattern's gauge notes. If your swatch is too big, you should try again with a smaller hook size. Likewise, if your gauge is too small, you should try again with a larger hook size. You may need to repeat this process with different hook sizes. 
 
 It's worthwhile to note that your tension can change during a project, especially when you are first learning how to crochet. This is normal! Your tension will improve as you practice.
