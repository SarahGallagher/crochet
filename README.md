# Crochet 

## What is crochet?
Similar to knitting, crochet is a method of "stitching" or "weaving" yarn to create a textile piece. 

The benefit of crochet is that you use one hook and work one stitch at a time. Because you don't carry your stitches on a needle like knitting, and because crochet hooks are quite short, it becomes very easy to travel with your work-in-progress without much worry about your stitches being dropped or pulled out. 

There are different types of crochet - traditional crochet uses the standard crochet hook (a "stick" with a "hook" at the end). You should start with traditional crochet before you move on to more advanced crochet pieces and techniques. 


## Getting Started
When you begin, you'll need two items: yarn, and a crochet hook.

Yarn comes in different weights, sizes, and content, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Acrylic yarn can be a great choice for beginners: it tends to be cheaper than other materials like wool or cotton, and it's typically very durable when reused in different projects. It's usually machine washable as well.

Likewise, crochet hooks come in a variety of sizes and materials. Most beginner and cheaper hooks are made with aluminum or plastic. Aluminum tends to be a better choice as it's more "slippery" than plastic. Hooks will vary in price and quality. 


## Yarn weight
The weight of your yarn refers to the size or thickness of your yarn, not how much it weighs.

It's important to note that yarn weight will vary between different yarns styles and yarn brands. What one brand would define their yarn weight as, another brand would define it a different weight. 

It's very common to use a different yarn than the pattern actually calls for. If you're planning to substitute yarns, you should check your gauge before you begin the pattern. 


## Gauge
Gauge is a measurement, or "scale", of your crocheted stitches. Gauge is unique to each person. Your yarn weight, how you hold your yarn and your hook, as well as how "loose" or "tight" you crochet, will affect your gauge (or, the overall size of your project). 
 
To measure your gauge, you'll first crochet a sample swatch. A swatch is typically a large square crocheted in the same main stitch as the pattern (or another stitch defined by the author). You'll start with the same yarn weight and the same hook size as the pattern calls for. 

After your swatch is complete, you'll use a ruler to measure a section of your square -- usually a 4 inch by 4 inch section --- to see how many of your stitches fit in that section vertically and horizontally. Note: because your first and last rows may have a different tension than the middle of your piece, you should avoid using the first and last row in your measurement (measure the middle section of your swatch sample). 

If your swatch is too big (i.e. you don't have enough stitches in your gauge measurement), you should try your swatch again with a smaller hook size. Likewise, if your swatch is too small (i.e. you have too many stitches in your gauge measurement), you should try again with a larger hook size. You may need to repeat this process a few times with different hook sizes until your swatch measurements closely match the author's.
 
It's worthwhile to note that your tension can change during a project, especially when you are first learning how to crochet. This is normal! Your tension will improve as you practice. 

## Optional materials
### Stitch markers
Stitch markers are used to "mark" a stitch. Stitch markers can come in different materials, ranging from pre-made plastic pieces, to something more simple like a contrasting piece of scrap yarn. Anything that can "mark" a stitch can be used as a stitch marker.

It's common to place stitch markers in the first and last stitches of your row, especially when you are first learning how to crochet, to prevent accidental row increases or decreases. 

It's also common to use stitch markers when you are working in the round, or when working with textured yarn where it's difficult to see your individual stitches (like faux fur yarn). 

### Yarn bowl
A yawn bowl is bowl or container that holds your yarn as you crochet. Some yarn bowls have cutouts or holes that you can use to better direct your yarn.

### Tapestry needle
Typically used to help you weave in/hide your ends. You can also use a regular crochet hook to weave in your ends, though, a tapestry needle can weave through the yarn fibres and may secure your ends better. 

## Common stitches and techniques  
Most crochet patterns are a combination of common crochet stitches. 

Most crochet patterns use stitch abbreviations. You should look for a stitch legend on the pattern page to explain what each one means. 

### Terminology
This document uses US crochet terminology. Before you learn a new stitch or begin a new project, you should always check what terminology the author is using (US, UK, or other).

### Slip knot 
### Slip stitch (slst)
### Single crochet (sc)
### Half double crochet (hdc)
### Double crochet (dc)
### Bobble, or popcorn
### Technique: Back loop only (blo)
### Technique: Front loop only (flo)
### Technique: Back post (bp)
### Technique: Front post (fp)
 
## Borders
Borders can be a great way to finish your crocheted piece! They are also a great way to hide tension variations or bumpy edges.

One common technique is to single crochet (sc) once around your piece before you add your decorative border: this gives you a good foundation row to build the rest of your border off of. 

## Holding your hook and yarn
As you gain experience crocheting, you'll develop a preference on how you like to hold your yarn and crochet hook. 

There are lots of ways to hold your yarn. You'll figure out your preferred method as you crochet and practice your tension control. Your yarn shouldn't hurt: if you are getting "rope burn" while crocheting, you should loosen your grip or hold your yarn a different way.

There are also lots of way to hold a crochet hook. Two common ways are the "knife" grip and the "pencil" grip. Your hand shouldn't hurt while crocheting. If you are getting pain while crocheting, you should loosen up your grip or hold your hook a different way.
